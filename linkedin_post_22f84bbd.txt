I built a full-stack multi-agent AI engine in 24 hours.

I used to think prompts were enough.

I was wrong.

To get expert-level content, you need architecture.

I built a multi-agent LinkedIn creator in 24 hours.

Here is the framework I used to ship it:

1. The Interface
→ Used Lovable for the WebUI.
→ Built a CLI for speed.

2. The Backend
→ Claude Code handled the heavy lifting.
→ FastAPI and PostgreSQL for the core.

3. The Orchestration
→ LangGraph for agent coordination.
→ LangChain for the logic.

Why agents over prompts?

Prompts are just instructions.

Agents are experts with memory.

They ensure quality at every step.

The hardest part?

Managing state and memory with LangGraph.

It was a steep learning curve.

But the result is a viral post machine.

Right now, it runs on Gemini.

Next stop: Claude Opus for peak performance.

Should I open-source the code or launch it as a tool? Let me know below.
